Renzo Gagliardi,"Shawn S. was the best at trying to find the best car and deal for us! He even invited us to lunch because we lost track of time looking at cars and test driving! Overall, everyone at Ken Garff is always pursuing their best to provide the best customer service! Great experience and 100% recommended!

My salesman was McKay and he was incredibly patient with my endless test driving and was diligent in finding me a car that I loved.

Jesse Riley,"Hondaâs response is a total cop out and a lie, no one ever looked into it and reached out to me.  See review below.DO NOT BUY HONDA!  We will never buy another Honda again.  We had an Odyssey for 6 years were so that we loved and my wife had decided she would be a lifelong Honda owner.  Bought 2016 Pilot  and loved all of the upgrades and what a great car it was.  Started having issues with it a couple of months ago, having the whole dashboard light up like a Christmas tree and it would run rough.  My wife or I would have to disconnect the battery EVERY SINGLE TIME before driving it and it would drive ok again.  Took it to Ken Garff Honda and were told that it was a manufacturer defect, IT HAD ORIGINALLY BEEN MADE WITH THE DEFECT.    They originally said because it was just out of warranty they could not do anything about it.  We appealed and they said their best offer was to cover half of the $2500 in repairs.  So we are stuck with $1250 in repairs for car that is only 2 years old! we spent the extra money because of how dependable Honda's are.  We are repairing, selling and buying something else.  Hope that $1250 was worth it to lose life long Honda customers.",FALSE,4,0,1,2 weeks ago,1,a month ago,"Jesse, we are so sorry to hear about this experience.

Linda Oldroyd Ellsworth,"Really enjoyed the buying experience from Ken Garff. The salesman wasn't too pushy, and we were in and out pretty quick, but it wasn't until after we got home we saw on the Carfax website that the car we had just purchased had been in a fender bender. I appreciate it when a dealership is upfront and honest about those things. Even though it wasn't a salvage or rebuilt title, I still would have liked to have known, because we overpaid for a car that had been in an accident.

Lindsay Christensen,"Everyone at Ken Garff in Orem went above and beyond to help me and my husband with our new car. I was recently in an accident that totaled my car, about 2 weeks shy of closing on our first home. Insurances werenât helping us, and we needed a new car ASAP. Everyone at Ken Garff was willing to wait to process all of our paperwork until we close on our house, which has been such a huge weight off of our shoulders. While I still wouldnât recommend buying a new car and a new house at the same time, I highly recommend coming here for your next car purchase.

q,Bought a Honda Pilot 2017. When I hit 30k I started to have problems. By the time I went in I couldnât use my warranty because they said I was over the limit by 500 miles.  I had to buy an extended warranty for them to fix the problem (all my dashboard warnings were going off) They had to fix my fuel injector. 2000k later my check engine light came on again and my vehicle is again sputtering when I take off.

Klay Ashby,"Sales associate agreed to replace front bumper cover as condition of purchase, but will not return calls or respond in any way. Have contacted store six times already and was very polite, but maybe I need to be as rude as they seem to be unprofessional to get results.

After a hopeful comment on my post suggesting that I would be hearing from the sales manager, nothing ever happened. I still hope Charlie Madon will uphold his promise to replace the front bumper cover cover, but I'm not holding my breath.  The finance team even told me that any items like that were separate from the as-is document I signed, so not to worry about it. At this point I feel ripped off and lied to.

J Spencer,"I was towed in on Garff Care as my car became disabled. I was quoted over $1300 for the repair. When I opted out of the quoted work and came in to get my car a week later I was charged $65 for 'diagnosis'. Plus my window was down. I paid you guys $65 to drop my window and keep it down for who knows how long? My regular mechanic quoted the repair for just less than $600. Guess how much the tow quote was to get it from Honda to the mechanicâyep, $65. So this Garff Care benefit pitched at time of sale has been exposed as a simple scam... ""We'll rescue you on the Wasatch Front if a car you buy from us breaks down... but if you refuse the overpriced service, we'll charge youâindirectlyâ for the tow.""

Colby C,"I get yearly email notifications about my car purchase which is a nice touch. Whether it's automated or personal I get a nice email from the seller saying thanks again for your purchase, let us know if you need anything else! I'm getting a little tired of the flyers I get about my car being a hot item and them wanting to trade me up! You don't get near what you can for a trade in and it's rather annoying to be offered so low. Great service as I got about 9 free oil changes that were semi synthetic I believe! Problem is I had an issue with the drain plug not being installed properly on one service and I took it to Hyundai in Lindon to find that out and run some tests as it was causing my car to shut down. I was driving in a few parking lots when it decided to just shut down my car. I would turn the key and it would just click. I shut it down then started back up and it was fine, but it wasn't until they fixed the issue at Hyundai that it stopped happening. I went back to this location to explain and they were nice enough to top me off with oil again but there was oil splattered all under the underside of my vehicle. Also, not too long after my oil change my underguard, the black plastic that protects the underside of your engine started to fall off on the freeway. Seems like the black clips that get put in either failed or weren't properly installed. To say the least the front end was being blown down to the point that it started to grind on the freeway and broke off the front bits so I had to macgeiver the front end until I got back from work and then had to zip tie it. It's the underside of the vehicle so it's not a big deal that it looks ghetto, but simple attention to detail when changing the oil would have been nice for them to either let me know or at least take time and install it properly! (I've heard this is sometimes removed to change the oil.)",TRUE,23,3,4,3 weeks ago,0,2 weeks ago,"Colby, thank you for taking the time to tell us about your experience.

They told me that they drove up to American Fork and back as the engine needs to be warm to detect the issue. I pick up my car later that night and notice the odometer hasn't even moved!

doug hicken,"Well, interesting I would say.  I brought my car in with an issue I knew would be difficult and I don't think they believed me.  Needless to say after a week they did.  Instead of getting on with Honda tech they waited.A few things they could improve on:1) document what happens in the computer so that when I call and my 'service advisor' isn't available that someone has any type of clue what is going on.  When we picked the car up they had no idea what they had or hadn't done on it because my service advisor wasn't in. 2) Reply to my texts using your text service3) Answer the phone.  I can't tell you how often I called and no one answered4) When you say someone will telephone me back in half an hour actually have someone do it.  I waited six hours5) Don't leave the car on empty after driving it around to troubleshoot it.  I gave them permission to put gas in it yet when we picked it up it was absolutely empty.6) Listen to your customers.

This to me shows laziness and unwillingness to serve a customer. I feel like this place has poor customer service and that they waste precious time. And no, movie tickets will not change my opinion. Movie tickets do not fix brakes. You would think that a car dealership would care more about their customers to keep business.

Andrew Whittaker,"I am enjoying my truck. After spending $2000 extra to get it into working order, it is a fine machine. However, the experience I had while purchasing it has chased me off from ever walking past their front doors again.At the time, their salespeople did not sell me a truck. No, what this dealership sold me was a death trap. The engine was constantly shutting down while I was out driving, the transmission was falling out, and half the time the truck wouldn't even start. Several times I took the truck in so their mechanics could correct these issues, but the only thing they could correct was the electrical short that was causing the engine to shut down. I took it to my personal mechanic and they found the starting issue the first time. The embarrassing lack of skill that their mechanics showed is matched by the bullying I received by the sales manager at the time. I took the truck in less than a week after signing my contract in order to attempt to unwind the deal and get my trade-in back. I was lied to and told they had already sold the trade-in, this after being told it would take a few weeks to get the vehicle ready to sell because of some damage by the rear tires. When I wanted to unwind anyways, your sales manager at the time threatened to take me to court if I didn't cooperate. I broke down in tears at the time as the only way out for me was to walk away with a death trap.""Ken Garff: We Hear You"". Well, hear this. Ken Graff managers strong-arm people into keeping the POS vehicles they sell and employees incompetent mechanics. I am never walking through their doors again.Edit: Reply to Ken Garff's Reply: Your GSM threatened to take me to court because I wanted out of a deal and lied to me about selling my trade-in. If that's what you consider ""working with me"" then you have a lot to learn about business.",TRUE,29,1,1,a week ago,0,a week ago,"Mr. Whittaker, we are so sorry to hear about this experience.

Sheryl Preston,Shawn Soto really made it a great experience. I came in to look at what they had available. Iâve owned two Honda vehicles in the past and knew that they were reliable vehicles when taken care of. Shawn was knowledgeable and without excessive reiteration (that you usually get with most salesmen) I did not have to state more than once the things I was interested in a vehicle. He was personable. He was not pushy and did not try to sell me into any vehicle. I left the lot without a car last week. I still needed to find a car before Monday and had been searching using other websites and car companies. I searched all weekend and through the next week. Yesterday I got a call from Shawn. He said he had two new cars just in (one of which that was SO new that it was not listed on their websites inventory yet.) He remembered the characteristics I was interested in specifically and began to list all the features I was looking at (and remembered all the features one by one). I came in within a few hours and was able to inspect the vehicle before anyone else.  The best salesman out there and Iâve seen quite a these last few weeks. This sale only happened because he was attentive and paid attention to what I needed.  He even tried to work with me to get a lower price and helped get the car through their inspection TWICE to ensure it was looking great inside and out. He even was able to throw in a much needed roof rack. Thank you!,FALSE,1,0,5,4 months ago,0,3 months ago,"Sheryl, thank you for taking the time to tell us about your experience.

C. A. Willie,"Shady2 stars because car dealerships are always shady.Tried to buy an odyssey and they tried to add a 2000 extended warranty without even mentioning it to me. Demanded to see the paperwork...turns out the extended warranty is practically worthless and if a honda cannot get to 85k miles without requiring 2k in repairs then I will never buy a honda again. Every single time I bring it in for an oil change, they claim I need new air filters. Twice now I have changed 1 or the other engine or cabinet air filter within a week of bringing it in and each time they still claim both need to be replaced. They are not horrible just check your paperwork, check your paperwork to make sure they are not seeking you something you dont want, and always say no to any extra work they suggest at the service center then go get a 2nd opinion somewhere else.",TRUE,94,4,2,a day ago,0,a day ago,"We would love to have the opportunity to speak with you about this and get some more details from you.

kadenpope4,"My 2002 Accordâs power window  motor went out. Super frustrating but itâs an old car and it happens. I called Ken Garff Honda first to see what the cost would be. I assumed that since they were a licensed Honda dealer they would do a good job at the best price. They told me that for the part and labor they would be at $816. I thought it was strange because I had seen earlier online that the part was only $80-100. The technician then told me that the majority of the cost was the part they needed to replace it and at that point I knew these guys were screwing me. That being said, the people that I talked to on the phones were top notch and I think they were very genuine people. I have no problem with the way I was treated. The issue was I was able to get everything fixed from another mechanic for $200. I would have been out an additional $600 on a car that isnât worth that much more. I donât think it is the peopleâs fault, I think it is an issue with the organizations hierarchy and where they are trying to make their money.

The guy I was working with was completely glued to his phone the entire time I was with him, but most of all (and the biggest reason for the 1 Star); They offered me an obscenely offensive number for the car I was trading in.

Evan Cox,"Mechanics lie. Over everything else, this is my biggest beef with them. You can never tell if their mechanics are telling you the truth about your vehicle. Every visit I've had, they tell me something else is wrong and that what they previously said was wrong is now ok (I never did any of their steps from before). This last time, they told me I needed to replace my air filters. I replaced them not even 6 months ago. On my previous visit, they said two of my brakes were wearing down while the other two were fine (which is odd since the car is only a couple years old, I bought it brand new). This time, they said all my brakes were fine. I had no brake work done at all, not even a check on them. When confronted with the information, they tried to say all sorts of garbage to defend themselves. They also have a driver there (one of those that takes you to work or home when you're waiting for your service) who plays with her phone while driving, changing music and who knows what else. Scary driver. The older gentleman who drives around in a Honda Odyssey is the only good driver they have (he's good). But everything else about this place is junk.

They had included replacing brake pads, and a few other repairs, which added $400 onto my final price. I called and they immediately explained that the additional repairs were only recommended, not necessary. It all worked out, I was just glad I checked because it saved me $400.

Flyingfrench men,"Worst service ever!!! Had a issue with my AC working, Took my car in to get fixed, three hours later i was told i needed an new ECM/ECU. The part was a $800 dollar part plus $150 for labor. So i went out and got another used one and return to see if this will fix the issue prior to buying a new one. So i shelled out the $150 for the labor and still no AC. Had to make another appointment since they didn't have anytime to continue troubleshooting since their was no notes from the first troubleshooting session(even thou i made an appointment they needed to tech to finish another job). On my way home my car completely stop work due to the connectors on my ECU where not place on correctly. After getting my car home i did some trouble shooting and found out there was no Freon in my AC system. Normally that's an easy fix but about seven months ago and I put in a brand new engine at the cost of $4000. So i brought that car back again so they can charge the AC system and see if that works. After the AC service it worked correctly. So after that they have apologize for having not trouble shooting the issue and didn't charge me for any service. Sure glad I didn't buy the new ECU. Anyway, tried to get my $150 back from the second trip and the service manager refused to give me that money back since the condition/age of the car and supposedly a weak/bad ac condenser.  So my story is if you need to have any major repair needed on your car make sure you get a second opinion. They just lost my business for life. I have own one Honda or more since 1993, currently have three at home. So i will be going to their competitor in the future. Buyers beware!!Update: That night after returning to work to check out the car the AC is still not working and there is no Freon in the car. So what did they do? Even my Wife when she picked up the car stated it was blowing warm air. If there was a leak they would of found it while the were doing the AC system.Not sure what their issue with their maintenance team,  sounds to me they are just an overpriced jiffy lube and all they want is to work on newer cars since i was told many time my car has many miles.Response from their comment: Yes you did refund my money (send a check in the mail)? Yes, you paid for the service that wasn't needed since your mechanics did not troubleshoot the system correctly and even thou you did service my AC system it still didn't work. No freon in the system means two things, one you didn't do the service or their was a leak. If a leak was present during the service your mechanic would of seen the pressure drop in the system and I would presume you would let me know about it and I would of had you fix what ever the issue was. But again poor service on your part to include customer service.",FALSE,1,0,1,7 months ago,0,7 months ago,"We are sorry that you are upset about your experience with our store.

Skyler Mann,"*((It's been 2 months since my initial review and still no help from Ken Garff. Very Poor Service.))*I always thought it would be a great experience buying a new car from Ken Garff Honda of Orem, until I actually bought one. Don't get me wrong, most people I've worked with while looking at cars have been good, and it's a nice ""no pressure"" environment. But unfortunately the caliber of the company and all its employees doesn't match with the few good people I HAVE worked with.I bought a brand new Accord and have had several issues with it, and can't seem to get the help needed to get the issues fixed. My brand new Accord came with a dent in the frame, and I've tried getting appointments set up to fix it, but it isn't getting fixed. The first time my car had work done, my salesman ""forgot"" to let the Service department know that it needed to be fixed. So other work got done (work that I paid for, like tinting and a clear bra), but not the other work they promised to do, like the dent. I've gone in several times to have work done, after my salesman said he'd talk with the Service department to get things worked on, and each time I go, nobody in Service knows what is happening, or what work needs to be done. So my salesman seems to not care enough to help get the issues fixed. And on the one day that he said he would be there to advocate for me, he had an ""emergency"" and couldn't be at the office to help out.They say they offer ""loaner"" cars to those who need them while their cars are in the shop, but I basically had to fight my salesman to be able to get a ""loaner"" car while mine is in the shop getting fixed so I can get to work and back. He refused for awhile, saying that my car's work (getting the dent fixed that they didn't fix before selling the car) didn't meet their criteria for getting a ""loaner"" for the day, or even for just a few hours. After awhile he finally was able to ""work it out so I could use one"", but that didn't pan out since I didn't even end up leaving my car. Since nobody knew about my appointment, I just took my car and hoped to get another appointment set up in the future.The bluetooth in the car is one of the biggest issues that the Accord has. While listening to music on my phone, the bluetooth will disconnect, and say it can't connect to my device (my phone). That error sits on the screen for a bit, then the bluetooth connects just fine again, and the music picks up where it left off. It happens all the time, unfortunately. It happens about once every 7 minutes. Sadly it's happened enough for me to quantify the issue, which is really frustrating. I've brought this up to my salesman on several occasions, and he has simply blamed it on phone cases being ""too thick"", which is definitely not the case. It's not just happened with my phone, but other people who have used the car's bluetooth, and they have had the same issue with it disconnecting. And they have had no phonecases, or very thin ones. So that's another issue that my salesman/Honda just isn't working to fix, unfortunately.The last issue is that there is a whistling sound that is very loud when accelerating the car. It goes very high pitch the more you accelerate the car. My salesman said he would have Service check that out, but each time I've gone in, nobody in Service knows about me coming in or knows about any work needing to be done. I usually just stand there for awhile while someone goes around and talks to other people in Service, asking if anybody knows what's going on with my car, or if my salesman talked to them. But after awhile, they always give the same answer, that no salesman has talked to them, and they don't know what work to do, so it doesn't get done.It's been a really unfortunate and frustrating experience, especially because it's a brand new car; one that should work/be in pristine order. Honestly, I'm not sure if I'll buy from them in the future again or not. So far, from what I've experienced, I probably won't. But I guess we'll see what they do about this in the (hopefully not too distant) future...",FALSE,2,0,1,3 months ago,0,5 months ago,"Skylar, we are so sorry about the experience you have had with us.

Luke McPherson,"Unfortunately we have a variety of issues with the service department that left me feeling like one way or another they were trying to gouge me on the price and force me into a situation where we would need to buy a new car from them.  We had a middle row seat-belt lock up on my wifeâs 2006 Honda Pilot.  I started taking the rear panel apart to see if I could fix it myself.  In the process of doing some online research for the repair, I realized that the seat-belt was covered by a life-time warranty so we decided to take it in to have it fixed.  Thatâs where the issues started.1.	First they told me that because I had opened up the compartment, it was considered âtampered withâ so it was no longer covered by the warranty.  I figured that I would let that slide as âmy mistakeâ for not looking into the warranty info first.  2.	After they did a diagnostic they called my wife and told her that it would be $350 to fix the seat-belt.  We told them âno thank youâ and that weâd get it done elsewhere.  But later when we picked up the car they gave us a printed estimate with the various repairs that they felt needed to be fixed.  I reviewed the printed estimate that night and the seat belt repair was $219, not $350.  I called them to ask why we were told $350 and they looked through everything and couldnât come up with a reason.3.	Also, when my wife went to pick up the car, they asked if we wanted to trade it in.  I was grumpy about not covering the seatbelt with the warranty and by telling us it would be $350 to fix it, so I said that I didnât feel like doing business with them.  So then they asked if weâd consider an offer from one of the service technicians.  They then came out with a huge list items that they said needed to be fixed, and said theyâd give us $300 for the car, which is basically just a salvage value.  The car runs fine and weâve had very few issues with it over the years.  4.	After finally getting everything figured out with the correct price ($219) for the seatbelt repair, I decided to go ahead and take it back in for the repair.  I left a Ziploc bag in the car with all of the screws that I had taken out of the back panel in the car so that they could put them back in after they finished the repair.  We even had another mechanic shop offer to do it for us for free.  The Honda service department replaced the seatbelt, but didnât put a single screw for the panel back in.

Lauren Brooksby,"Update: Honda cut me a deal to fix the head gasket which has been done for about 8 months now and hasn't given me any problems. I appreciate their willingness to work with me on making things right. Additionally I had a small problem today and was able to go in and was helped by Kyler in the shop who was able to do what I'd been trying to do for six hours, in about 15 minutes. And he didn't charge me. Honda has made things right with me as far as I am concerned.Told me nothing was wrong with my car when it was overheating. They said they checked the head gasket and it was fine. So I spent $600 on other repairs to fix the overheating and turns out it was the head gasket all along. It will take thousands to fix that on top of the $600 I've already spent.

B L,We had been searching for a Honda Odyssey for a long time and weâre so excited to find the perfect one for us. However the sales guy was super rude. We would have gone somewhere else but wanted the car so bad we just kept going. We purchased it and after detailing it came back with a dark rock chip dead center in the windshield. The guy denied knowledge of it and had me come in. Only to have some sketchy guy fill it who was also super rude. When I called to complain he told me it was always there. Even during the test drive so now all of the sudden he was aware of it???? They told me theyâd pay for half of a new windshiled but thatâs still more money out of our pockets for something THEY did. Never again Ken Garff. Pure sketchy!!!! No they do not âhear youâ their customers. Beware!!!!,FALSE,5,0,1,10 months ago,0,10 months ago,"Weâre so sorry you have been frustrated with the rock chip, and we understand that our team was able to fix that chip free of charge and is willing to help replace the windshield.

Skyler Kent,"Great experience at Ken Garff. JJ, the GM was really great at corresponding with me, since I live out-of-state. I showed up and the vehicle was already completely ready to go. He kept his word on what we had discussed and did everything he could to make it as smooth of a process as possible. He hooked me up with Cornel who did a great job finalizing everything for me. I actually went and purchased another vehicle at a different dealership with my aunt immediately after leaving Ken Garff, and I have to say that it was a night and day different experience. It took 7 hours longer, it was all games, manipulation, dishonesty, and stressful. It made me really appreciate my experience with Ken Garff.

Dallin Brown,"DO NOT use Honda Service Orem!!!!  DISHONEST AND OVER-PRICED. HORRIBLE experience with service department (specifically Brandon), multiple times. The first bad experience I had was because of the ridiculous price they quoted me for a repair. I called around to get price quotes (with price breakdowns). When comparing labor prices, I discovered that Honda was charging OVER 3 times the amount for LABOR, than any other shop in the area for the exact same job. To make things worse, they also marked up the after-market parts by over 200%. I understand that the Honda parts would be nicer and cost more, but when comparing one after-market part to another, they should be in the same ball park, not well over twice as much. (all this happened one year ago).Fast forward to now (Feb 2018), the same part that was replaced a year ago went bad again; needs to be replaced, no big deal. I went in to Honda and Brandon (the service manager), told me that the parts were not under warranty because I did not use the Honda part (I used after-market parts). Brandon wanted to charge me over $600 to replace the part (around 300 for the Honda part and about 300 for labor)  After talking to some other mechanics in the area, I found out that the parts ARE under warranty. Brandon literally LIED to my face. On top of it, every single shop I called quoted me under 110 for labor; once again, Brandon marking up the labor cost by 3x. If you want to pay three times as much as you should, go to Honda. If not, go ANYWHERE else.",FALSE,2,0,1,9 months ago,0,9 months ago,"Dallin, we are so sorry for the frustrating time you've had getting this part replaced.

Charles Polidori,"I called the Ken Garff Honda dealership before coming in and talked to a salesman named Parker. He gave me a lease price and I was very specific with my questions. I asked for a monthly payment for a lease and I was told $139 per month with $2400 down.  I asked if that was plus tax and he replied yes.I also asked how many miles the lease was and he said it was12000 per year.  I also asked him if he had different colors to choose from and he replied, we have them all.  I explained I was in from out of town and I was helping my daughter buy a car. I also was clear that I did not have time to waste and to please be forthcoming and that I wanted to make extra sure that he was fair with me.  When we went the next day, things couldn't have been further from the truth. He only had 1 color to choose from and the the price was not even close to what he had promised me on the phone. When I asked what happened to the $139 price, he said that it was âtoo tricky to get there"". I asked him what that meant and he said that he had made a mistake and the $2400 did not include the deposit which still didnât  even make sense because that was only $139 more.  Please don't fall into the same trap as I did and don't let them sell you a car for more than promised. I walked out and I will find an honest place to do business.

I gave her my number, asked her to call me and never heard from her until after I called HER extension to schedule a test drive.

I told her I found something else and she said âok thank you. iâll note that.â and then that was it.

Kiya Hall,"I wrote a poor review for this company a few years ago and they contacted me and made me remove it by holding a refund that was due to me hostage. If you do choose to do business with them, which I highly discourage, please do three things. First, before you sign the final papers CHECK THE LENGTH OF YOUR LOAN. I was quoted an estimate for my monthly payment while working with a salesman who then sent me to the finance department. At that point I was given the official monthly payment which was close to the original quoted price. However, the life of my loan had been nearly doubled! The price was so similar because they had added on an insurance that only makes sense if you are buying a brand new car, and I was buying used. Second, immediately have your car CHECKED BY AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC. I was sold a car that did not pass safety and emissions because the ball joints were bad. My understanding is that it is illegal for a dealer to sell a car that cannot pass safety and emissions. They sold the car to me because it passed S&E with their in-house mechanics, but those mechanics did shoddy work. Everything about my experience was horrid right done to them accusing me of having forged a signature so that they could get out of doing work that they had agreed to do while negotiating the price of the vehicle. Thus, as my third tip, GET EVERYTHING IN A FORMAL CONTRACT. Don't trust anything they say - even if it's written down by hand with their signature on it - get it typed and legally binding.",FALSE,6,0,1,a year ago,0,a year ago,"We want to ensure that all of our customers have a good experience, but we can't find you in our database.

However, when I brought my vehicle in for service, I asked them for the recommended service and I asked them to simply change out my cabin light that burnt out.

He noticed the leak and said they could definitely look at that and take care of it if I scheduled an appointment. The thing is, I did schedule an appointment and the technician that looked at my vehicle and gave it a passing grade did not do his job, and nobody seemed to care. If the technician did not truly review the car when he reviewed the checklist, what else did he skip? What else did he not care about? And why was my car not properly fixed when I mentioned it more than once? Why would I need to make another appointment and come back a second time when I did make an appointment and they did not do their job the first time?

Drew Briney,"Positive: I love my car and I appreciated their willingness to finance my third or fourth vehicle purchase.Negative: I went to Ken Garff Honda of Orem because of their ""We Hear You"" ads. I was tired of dealers who were pushy and disinterested in customer service. One of the sales reps told me they spent something like $5 million on that ad.  I wish there was a kernel of truth to it. I've been four months without a car now.  Thanks Ken Garff.  The Oregon DMV told me to send a registration packet to the dealership where I leased my Honda Civic. I overnighted the package with forwarding postage information in the packet.  Nothing happened.  I made follow up phone calls and left messages. No one ever called me back.  I was going to make a phone call stating that I was looking to purchase a fleet of vehicles to see if that would get their attention but I got a live person on the line so they transferred me to their financial department.  The guy said ""Oh, that was supposed to be sent to Honda Financial, not us."" I noted that no one ever called to tell me, no one returned the package, and apparently, no one forwarded the information to Honda Financial.  He said he'd look into it and call me back. I hoped they'd forwarded the information and that it was in process but that hope was vain. That phone call was roughly a couple months before I wrote this review. No return call has come.  Apparently, they only ""Hear You"" if you're purchasing a new vehicle.  Otherwise, they seem disinterested in taking care of existing customers.  I take it back ... my mistake ... they DID call to complain when my auto-pay failed because I changed banks. That phone call was when someone actually gave me the department contact information I needed for registration problems.So, I sent a new packet of information to Honda Financial with the information the Oregon DMV said to fill out. The DMV said the dealership should fill in remaining boxes so I left them blank.  Weeks later, Honda Financial sent the information back asking me to fill in boxes the DMV said the dealerships prefer to fill in and to sign (where the DMV clerk told me not to sign) so I sent the information back to Honda Financial - third time processing the paperwork. To be fair, the Oregon DMV ridiculously takes 6 weeks to process an out of state registration (though they generously give you temporary permits for an extra charge but only for those 6 weeks).  If the dealership takes any time at all to turn in the paperwork, you're out of luck driving your car unless you want to risk a hefty ticket.  Since, Ken Garff Honda of Orem wasn't professional enough to listen to any of my voicemails or to return the registration packet or to do anything else pro-active for an existing, non-purchasing customer, I'm out of a car for many weeks. Thanks for listening Ken Garff Honda of Orem.On a separate note, I went to the Orem branch once to look into upgrading my vehicle.  I knew I couldn't afford it for a few months but I wanted to look into options before committing to a purchase.  The salesmen were immediately present to see if I could be helped but once I informed the sales rep that I wouldn't be purchasing for a few months, he charmingly told me to enjoy looking at the various vehicles on display and to let him know when I was ready to purchase something.  So much for answering my questions.",FALSE,3,0,1,7 months ago,0,7 months ago,"Drew, thank you for taking a moment to speak with us about your experience.

Brea Gwilliam,"Unfortunately I have had nothing but problems with the Honda Accord they sold me less than a year ago. When I went in to have a routine oil check with them several months ago, the mechanic let me know that Ken Garff had messed up and looked past the fact that my rotors are completely corroded.  They sold the car to me as is, but there have been countless problems. For several months, my car has been having problems starting. Come to find out I have a bad alternator.  They should do a much better job at taking care of the cars they sell. I am not happy with the way that they treat their cars. When selling a car for the price I paid, there should not be this many problems. I will not be buying any cars from them in the future.  It is really lame that they can't take care of their customers and make sure a car is in good condition before selling. I wish I could have written a good review about them, but I am not pleased with the company at all.",FALSE,2,0,1,a year ago,0,a year ago,"Brea, we are so sorry that your Accord has been so frustrating to deal with, and weâd like to talk to you about this asap.

Diane Johnson,"Avoid unless you do not have a choice. Needed warranty work done (seatbelt).  They were the nearest dealer (100 mile drive).  I made an appt for 9am. Arrived at the appt and was told they couldn't get me in until 10:30.  When I pointed out the appt was at 9, they said that was just a ""suggestion"" and it put me in line at that time.  Also told me airbags were on recall so they would be replaced and it would be at least an hour job.   Then to really complete the waste of time, before starting they did a  complimentary (and unasked for) 24 point inspection and somehow found over $3000 dollars of repairs needed. VERY overpriced.  An oil change for $500 (that was just done last week) and over $1000 for a tune-up.  No, I don't think so. Total ripoff.

My husband drives a Hyundai & it needed a repair. They ubered him both ways free of charge. Honda of Orem needs to step up.

christian youse,I did an alignment and a tpms sensor here on my Honda accord. I made it 10 feet from my parking space and the CV axel broke and the wheel collapsed into the wheel well. I understand that this is a wear and tear item but I've been driving it before with no signs of the CV axel going out. Further more in the inspection report they said that my car was in great shape. Maybe just switch out the fluids. After the axel broke they said the they did notice some greese leaking from the axel boot. I feel like maybe that should have been mentioned in my report. I am left wondering what kind of driving was done to the car while it was in there possession in order to make a CV axel brake just seconds after returning it to me and not at some other time. If I had made it onto the highway and something like this had happened I would be writing this from a hospital. Kind of scary. And no way I'm paying 500+ dollars to fix the axel that mystirusly broke after these guys gave the keys back. Had it towed to someone I can trust. If only I knew someone else that could program new tire pressure sensors I might not be in this predicament. (This was more of a vent then a personal vendetta against these guys.

Kevin Hoyt,"My wife and I had been shopping for several months for a particular combination of Pilot but there weren't ever any in the nearby dealerships so asked about ordering one from out of state. We negotiated a fair deal and signed the purchase agreement which we were assured would arrive by the following weekend.  Later that evening I discovered that the VIN listed on all of the paperwork was incorrect. It matched a different combination which was not what we agreed to purchase.  I immediately got in touch with my salesman so we could get the error corrected ASAP.  Although the other dealership sent the incorrect VIN, there's no reason that should have slipped through.  He assured me that everything would be corrected first thing Monday morning and there was nothing to worry about.I couldn't get a definitive answer from him about a replacement until the following Friday despite multiple contacts throughout the week.  He just have me vague answers Such as, ""just spoke with my manager, everything's good"".  My salesman let me know Friday afternoon that the Pilot would be arriving at the dealership on Saturday so my wife and I arranged our schedule so we could come pick it up.  We hadn't received any message by 2:30 so I reached out just to get a message that, ""the truck broke down so it won't be here till Monday"".  I inquired about the location of the truck thinking it may be possible to just meet it and pick up the vehicle but received a vague answer which included not having any idea where it was.  However, he did assure me that the truck had been repaired and was back on the road, and that the vehicle would be in the area on Sunday.  Because it's so difficult to get to the dealership during the weekdays my wife and I decided to make another trip to the dealership in order sign the paperwork with the updated VIN so we could drop by on Monday evening with just enough time to pick it up and go.  While there, our salesman completely forgot about promising us a trailer hitch and wiring for cost, and stated that it needed to be ordered even though I'd just checked at the parts counter and was informed there were three sets in stock.  That exchange made it clear to me that he had simply been saying whatever it took to get us to purchase when we were negotiating the terms initially.  I just mention this because I don't want to paint him as a terrible associate.The following Monday at noon I checked with him again to ensure that we could still pick up the Pilot and was told that we should still come in unless we hear differently from him.  By 2:00 he let me know that the vehicle wouldn't arrive until Tuesday night.  He offered to deliver it to my home, but frankly I no longer believed what he said and didn't want to deal with him anymore.  I called and asked for a sales manager and left a voicemail but didn't receive a call back so finally sent an email to the general manager that evening.  Within minutes I received a call from the sales manager who did get things arranged for us to pick up the vehicle that Thursday.The final frustration was that we had the dealership install a tow package before we picked it up and although the work was done well the bill was more than what I'd agreed to.  However, by this time I simply wanted to be done with the dealership so just paid it and left.What I would have expected during this whole experience is for my salesman to be proactively informing me of the situation rather than me needing to continuously ask him, and for him to be open and honest about the status rather than vague answers that I don't even feel were truthful.In the end we did get the vehicle we wanted for a fair price and suspect I would have been satisfied if purchasing a vehicle that was already on the lot.",FALSE,2,0,2,11 months ago,0,11 months ago,"Kevin, we are very sorry for any poor communication and unclear, vague answers to your questions, and weâd really like to personally apologize and do what we can to make this right.

Nate Evans,"11/24/17 updateI guess I'm a poor learner. I came back into Honda today to buy some windshield wipers. They pitched me their oil change deal that I could use over the next year, so I signed up and explained I'd activate it in the future. After waiting 20 minutes, I asked what the hold up was. They explained they had started the oil change, rotated my tires, and THEN realized I only wanted wiper blades...which would take another 15 minutes,  because they had to put my tires back to how they were. What a joke. Original review:I'm a dedicated Honda fan but have come to dislike the brand simply based on my experiences here. Simply put, I hated KGH of Orem. The service manager insulted me--literally called me names--when I brought my car in for a service check. Both times I have been in the market for a new car, their salesmen were pushy and impolite. I recently went in to look at buying a new car and hoping that in the year+ since I'd been in, things would have changed. They hadn't. The salesman, Ray, was unhelpful and aloof. I was nothing but a dollar sign to them. I will buy my car somewhere else.

The service manager let me stand at his desk talking to other employees and ignored me until his phone rang, answered the call and then passed me off to another employee because checking in a customer wasn't his job.

The latest experience was a warranty repair for a broken molding around the windshield. When I brought it in I waited opted to not wait around, because even though you make an appointment, that has nothing to do with when someone will look at your car. When I returned I was told that they didn't have the clip they needed and they were ordering one, and to just come back in a week and it would be 30 minutes to install it. I procrastinated returning for the clip to be installed because I have never had them take less than two hours for any of my non oil change services. I finally returned today, informed them that I was told earlier that it should only be a 30 minute fix, in and out.... Well that was at 8:15, and it's going on 10:30 now.

They performed two airbag recalls and I'm not sure if they were in a rush or just not familiar with the vehicle but the windshield is scratched on the inside and there are small indentations where they pried off the dashboard. I'm writing this because I just now noticed while detailing it. They also replaced my windshield wiper blades for free but they used the tacky cheap metal ones and not the sleek OEM blades. I wish they would have told me that because I would have declined. On a positive note they did have free snacks and friendly staff.Edit: The dealership contacted me and was willing to do everything possible to make corrections. They said that they made a mistake replacing the windshield wipers and offered me compensation for the OEM blades.

Brian Cole,"I bought a new Honda Ridgeline in May 2014 from Ken Garff.  They were my all-time favorite dealership, so much so that I have had my Ridgeline serviced only by them.  Now it has all changed into a nightmare!  While my Ridgeline was being serviced, they somehow hit my bumper and damaged it.  ""No problem we will take care of it"" they said.  I foolishly believed them.  The first time I took it in to be fixed they had my truck for three hours.  The day after I got it back, my bumper popped out of place.  I took it back and this time  they had my truck for a week, and the repair lasted about a week and then the bumper popped out again.  I was beginning to fear that they weren't taking me seriously and were not willing to fix my bumper, that they damaged, correctly.  Maybe I am just too nice and so they decide I was a chump that they could abuse because when I brought it back to be fixed the THIRD TIME, they had my Ridgeline for almost three weeks!  When I got my truck back. the first thing I noticed was the inside reeked of body odor and Brute.  After a few weeks the ""repair"" bowed out again.  Not only that, I can see that all they did was glue to small metal rods to the back of the bumper to hold it in place and now those bent-out metal rods have chipped the paint on the previously undamaged part above my bumper.  I figure, three strikes, you're out.  I have lost all faith and trust in Ken Garff.  I emailed them and said I just want to settle thru their insurance company.  They told me they are self insured.  I called my insurance company, and they recommended I talk to a lawyer because once I let Ken Garff ""take care of it,"" they can't help me.  My home teacher is a lawyer and he said to try and give them a bid from an auto body shop and hope they do the right thing. If not, he will refer me to a lawyer that specializes in this kind of thing.  Gee, thanks Ken Garff for ""Listening"" to me so well.Update, after seeing this review, they finally took care of me.",FALSE,2,0,1,a year ago,0,a year ago,"Brian, we are very sorry about your frustrating experiences getting your Ridgeline fixed.

We bought an Odyssey from them a few years ago, but getting them to own up on their promise of cross pieces for the roof rack was a chore, and you could tell they were not happy to do it. And when it comes to the service department, even knowing that they're going to overcharge me, but since they are supposedly the experts on Honda repair, it seems like they'd really rather not help me if it's anything more complex than an oil change, which I do myself.

A few months ago when I went in to get my oil changed, the guy told me I needed new brakes or my car wouldn't pass inspection. They told me I needed them replaced ASAP or I risk my personal safety, that of my family, and others on the road. They wanted $250+ to replace the brakes. I immediately took my car to another shop to get a second opinion and a better price, fully expecting to replace my brakes. As it turned out, they said my brakes were good to go. No need to get them replaced. Well today I got a third opinion when my car passed the safety inspection with my brakes being under 50% worn. WTF dealership.

Adam Lingard,"After attempting to set up a service date with the service desk and getting no call backs as promised, I had an airbag recall done on my  Honda Odyssey.  When I brought it in my car had no issues and had had no issues.  When I go it back my car's radio and navigation system were completely non functional.  I brought it to their attention and they said that they had touched nothing that would have caused this and it was a ""coincidence"" and nothing more.  I repeated my concern a second time and they ""looked into it"".  There was a fuse that was now blowing every time the car was turned on and they said it was still not them and provided a nice schematic of the electrical components showing that there was supposedly nothing related.  They said it could be due to the after market DVD system that had been in the car for years.  I then disconnected it completely and the issue was still there.  There does happen to be radio controls going through the steering column which I pointed out during my third complaint to the service rep.  They said that the person who does airbags has done so many that they can get it done in 10 mins and would not have caused any other issue.  In what I can only suppose was a placating measure, they let me know that they would run a diagnostics on the electrical system.I then received a survey in regards to my service and let them know how I felt, my treatment by the service center and how I had let family, friends and coworkers of the experience I was having.  I let them know in the survey that I had also called into a radio station that I happen to listen to every morning during a segment they have for such complaints.Finally after this, I was contacted by a manager at the dealer.They would take care of the issue and return the car to me in the condition in which I left it to them to have it worked on.The Navigation and Radio now turn on.We took a trip to St, George Utah and the SRS light cam on 3 times and the radio might pick up 1 station (without static).Now that we are back I will go to them again and endure further frustration.DO NOT UTILIZE THEM FOR SERVICE nor buy a car from them because you will get the same service for the car you purchase!-----------------------------I have since gone elsewhere and traded in my minivan so that I will not have to deal with this Dealership anymore!",FALSE,4,0,1,2 years ago,0,2 years ago,"Adam, we're sorry that you've had such a bad experience with getting your Honda Odyssey's issues taken care of at our dealership.

Anna Bennett,"I never write reviews, but I could not resist on this one. NEVER go to Ken Garff Honda of Orem. My brother, who owns a Auto Shop in Provo warned us not to deal with them, he has had nothing but bad experiences with them when it comes to purchasing parts for his shop. Unfortunately, I did not listen. First, they told us our brand new CR-V would be ready on a certain day. That day came and went, and still no car. When we purchased the car, we were told it would be put on a truck and brought to Orem. Several days had passed from the promised day, and still no car. The dealership, without permission, decided they were going to drive the car to Orem themselves. When we got the car, it had over 250 miles on it. It would have been nice to be made aware of what they were wanting to do. A ""brand new"" car with over 250 miles is a bit disturbing. Second, about a week after getting the car, we took it back in to get some parts added on. We dropped the car off at the dealership around 8:00 a.m., which is what we were told to do and we were also told before hand that it would only take a day to do everything. We get a call around 3:30 p.m., asking if we were going to bring the car in. Obviously no one knew the car had been there the whole day, meaning it hadn't been touched all day. Suddenly around 6:00 p.m. that day, we get a call from them again saying that they ""forgot"" to order a part and would need to keep the car for an extra day. Of course the car wasn't going to be done that day, they didn't even realize it was there until after 3:30 p.m. After having the car for two days, it was finally done. My husband and I go to pick up the car and it was a wreck. The doorframe on the drivers side had gouges in it. They were not just scratches on the clear coat, you could she down to the metal. There were also many scratches on the steering wheel, screen and bumper. The screen still has yet to be repaired by the dealership, as promised. For keeping the car an extra day, we were also promised by the general manager, JJ Wilkinson, that they would do a free detail on the car. The car didn't even look like it had been vacuumed, let alone detailed. We were told to leave the car with them because of the gouges on the doorframe. We get a call from our friend, JJ, the next morning giving us options on how to fix the mess they caused. JJ called me and was just wanting to put a light up door sill to ""hopefully cover most of the scratches."" After some discussion he agree to take my CR-V to an auto body shop to repair it. During this discussion, I expressed a lot of my frustration to JJ. He told me that ""getting mad at him only wanted him to help me less."" Sorry buddy, you guys damaged the car, so you get to fix it whether I am polite to you or not. They again promised the car would be done on a certain day. They fell through again, and the car was done about a week later than promised. Finally we get the car back, and thankfully they did actually fix all the damaged they caused. After getting home with our CR-V we did another inspection and discovered that now the sensored tailgate that we got added on is not working. Back to terrible Ken Garff Honda of Orem we go. Because of all the mess they caused, JJ, offered to refund us our money for the oil changes we purchased with the car. Now, more than 3 months later, we just got our refund, after having to remind him several times. Long story short, if you want to be severely screwed over and end up in a mess, go to Ken Garff Honda of Orem. I can promise you that we will NOT be going there again, even for something as simple as an oil change. I am sure they will manage to mess that up someone how too, just like they messed up everything else.

Benje M,"I was always happy when I went in they tried to help out in any way, until today. My key fob housing broke, went in to get a new one and they took care of me. Except they forgot that with a new key fob it is a new chip inside so it would not start my car due to not being programmed. I went back inside and they said we are sorry we will take care of it for you. And they were right on it. I waited 10 minutes and they took care of the problem. That is the good part, now for the bad. My wife had my other set of keys for my car and was not able to start my car. Well when they programmed the car for the new key fob it killed my spare one. Not a big deal figuring that I can just go back and have them just reprogram the new one. Went into day and ask if they could do it.

They don't have quality mechanics to repair even their own vehicles!My civic had a coolant leak in the head gasket that they were unable to diagnose and repair after seeing my car a half dozen times over several months. Their mechanics seem to rely too much on a computer to tell them what needs to be done.Each of these times I took in my '06 Civicâwith only 63K miles on itâthey'd only replace or clean off various sensors as well as topping off my coolant, which was oddly low each time. They didn't think twice about why that would be odd or think it too important to figure out where all the coolant was going!My car would run, at times no further than up the street, before overheating and having to return and have them look at it again. Then one day after returning home for 5 minutes from work, it just wouldn't start up again. I had it towed to their service center and they kept the car overnight, despite having scheduled an afternoon appointment. The next day they returned the car with only a simple cleaning of the air intake sensor. No mention of even needing a coolant top off this time. It clearly must have been overlooked because that same day my car got me as far as Downtown Salt Lake, where it overheated worse than ever and left me stranded 50 miles from home!The Downtown Salt Lake Honda dealer, where I had to have my car towed, diagnosed my engine and found the blown head gasket, a repair that required me to replace my entire engine, costing me $5K!Calling the Orem dealership to inform them of the poor quality of service I'd received from their mechanics, I was forwarded to the manager's voicemail.

Jacob Jewett,"My wife and I were looking for a suv that would drive well in the snow. We had a few cars in mind, and when a sales associate said he had a Gran Vitara I asked if it was AWD or rear wheel since I had read up on it. He said that it was front wheel drive and when I questioned him he went out and said he ""checked"" and that it was FWD. We bought the car only to find out it was rear wheel drive. I brought it back within the 3 days that they ""claim"" is no hassle. When I asked to return it because it wasn't what I was looking for the representative said ""Too bad"" and that it was our car, and we could trade it in that day only. I said that there wasn't anything in the inventory that I wanted at the time that fit our criteria. I said that the sales rep wasn't fully honest with us and I wanted my money back. If he worked with me I would have still gone through their company. He said that if I left the car he would have it towed at my expense.

Until I got to the car wash. I got the code with no problem and my car was rinsed (I would say washed but there was no power in the water as they only paid for basic) but as I pulled forward to the dryers, they didn't turn on.

First thing we noticed when we began the test drive was that the interior was absolutely covered in dog hair. The salesman said an employee must have driven the car with his/her dog in tow. He assured us it would be clean at the time of purchase, which it was. Second thing we noticed was the ""Service needed"" message when we turned the ignition. The salesman promised it had been serviced and would make sure it was looked at prior to sale. We negotiated a second key as part of the sale which was not ready on the day of purchase. After a week of telephone tag, we finally scheduled an appointment. When we showed up for the appointment, the salesman told us they didn't have the part, but perhaps a neighboring store would. He drove our vehicle without permission to a neighboring store, who worked on the key. That service department also performed a recall (which we were unaware of and they provided no paperwork so we don't even know what the recall was). After driving the vehicle for 2,000 miles, I took it in to our neighborhood Ken Garff for a complementary oil change/tire rotation (mandatory AdvantageCare that comes with every car purchase) in preparation for a big move. This service station informed us that two filters were filthy and needed to be replaced ($80), and the rear tires were cupping badly and were likely the result of an alignment or struts issue. Also, they didn't know if the 30,000 mile inspection had been performed (a $600 service). The dealership purchased the car at 31,000 miles and sold it to us at 38,000, so technically it could/should have been done prior to their ownership, but at the very least it should have been done prior to the sale to us. I have tried in vain to speak to anyone about these issues. I call sales, and they refer me to service, who says they can't do anything, but maybe a sales manager. I try and reach a sales manager and only ever get voicemail, and messages are not returned. In truth, some responsibility lays on us for ignoring the warning signs (dog hair and service needed message), but the moral of the story is, based on our limited experience with this dealership, they will take advantage of you if they can and are not accommodating after the point of sale.",TRUE,1,70,2,2 years ago,0,2 years ago,"Travis, we are sorry that you've had such a frustrating experience with our dealership.

Laura Perkins,"My mother in law had a great experience at Larry Miller. I mistakenly thought it was Ken Garff. Shame on me. We bought a car from them in September. They kept it to do a detail job which ""their guy was out of town so a couple guys just did it"" and there was still gross stuff all over the third row and gum on vinyl. they said it didnt come off so I did it myself and it wasn't difficult. So they had it detailed again. It was better for a $160 detail job it was ok. There was still sticky in the cup holder. which was cleaned out during a routine oil change (JB in service is the only person there who has been helpful also the only one Ive worked with in that dept)  When I picked it up within 4 hours i was stranded on I15. I got a tow truck to bring it back to them. The fuel pump went out. So I decided I didnt want that vehicle as there is a 3 day law to return cars. Lemon law or something. Anyways, they replaced a few things and as I know you cant tell its the fuel pump until it happens we ended up keeping the car on condition of any mechanical failure in the month they would take the car back. We paid 1500 (split with KG) to repair some rust along the back lights. We told them specifically not to worry about the bumper as it is plastic but when the paint job was done they had replaced the bumper and none of the rust. So they sent it back to their vendor who slapped some paint on top of rust. Well as we all know we fast forward 4 months and the all paint has chipped off exposing the rust again. I had called in my 3 day limit to ask about a few things and they were very willing over the phone to help me in those regards. When I got to the store however they told me since Id already signed papers they didn't have to do anything for me. I was told that I was ridiculous because of the paint job disagreement. And as of yesterday for the second time in less than 6 months. The car is waiting to go to the shop as it is broken down. Awesome.  I called the general manager JJ who is helping me deal with the paint vendor. If helpful I will update this post to let everyone know.

Saul Macias,Purchased a car at Ken Garff recently. Did not have a good experience for two reasons. I went in to purchase the car in the afternoon not much light (which could be my fault) but when i drove the car home i noticed a large scratch on the bumper which i did not see before when i test drove the car. My thoughts are that the scratch occurred when they took it to get washed or on the way out. The reason i  think it happened after was because i could feel little residues/flaking on the scratch when i saw it the morning after. Second reason was i purchased the car and did not know it only had one key. Granted i know it was not a new car but i have purchased other used cars and they are usually upfront about this i was not notified until i was walking out and had signed all the paper work. Its these things which showed a lack of care. I will not be referring people to the dealer and honestly would advice you do not shop here. They could have easily told me about only having one key and  taken the care of fixing that minor bumper scratch and impressed me with honesty...i guess honesty and ken garff Orem don't go together.,FALSE,1,0,1,2 years ago,0,2 years ago,"Saul, we're sorry that your experience with our dealership was a negative one.

Ryan Bartley,"This is fairly long winded review, but trust me it is worth the read. I am not some crazy individual ranting about poor service. I am honestly concerned about the incompetent service department who put my family in danger many, many times. Originally I really appreciated their kindness, as I had taken my car into them a few times before this experience. Recently I took my 2005 Pilot in for a recall. I hadn't experienced the symptoms, but wanted to prevent them as they were extreme. The vehicle would randomly slam on the brakes, completely unprompted. My wife took the car in and had it fixed. About a week later we were driving on the freeway and the brakes came on throwing us into the other lane. Throughout this process, the brakes threw us into other cars and one time a semi (an accident was never caused but some were certainly very close calls). Anyway, I called them and they said the couldn't look at it for another week. In that time, the vehicle slammed on the brakes numerous times. I took it back in and they investigated and came back and said they had originally done it wrong. The were very unapologetic even though it endangered my family. Well, about two weeks later, the vehicle started doing it again! I called them back and they agreed to look at the vehicle again. After ""fixing"" it again, the assistant manager assured me he felt comfortable giving the vehicle back. The lady who gave us our vehicle back made it clear it was not longer their issue. So when it happened again a few weeks later, I called Honda USA and filed a formal complaint. I ended up driving to Sandy to have Stockton Honda look at it. They promptly found the issue -  Incorrect installation of a SINGLE ground wire, which was the entire point of the recall. Stockton Honda called the service manager at Ken Garff, Ed, and asked him to pay for it, which he wouldn't. He expected me to drive my vehicle down to him and trust him to fix it again. I called Honda USA again who was able to get Ed to agree to pay for the service at Stockton Honda. We haven't had the problem since.It took 2 and half months, 4 dealership visits and many hours of my time and gas money to get this recall fixed.

After purchasing it, I brought it in to get a TSB taken care of and to get the oil changed. I called the parts department a few days prior to make sure they had a key in stock so I could get a duplicate key. When I arrived, they were out of stock. JB had them special order one from the Salt Lake location and had it ready for me later that day. He even gave me a small discount on the labor on the oil change to compensate for the inconvenience that was having to get shuttled to work and back instead of taking care of it all first thing in the morning (7:30 am appointment). We filled out a survey from Honda detailing the experience, and one of the managers from the dealership sent us a handwritten letter thanking us for the feedback.

Or maybe it's a crutch for the sales person? I don't know, but it feels like the Wizard of Oz pulling strings behind the curtain and left a bad taste in my mouth.) They also tried to slip questionable add-ons onto the sale. I wish dealerships would be upfront with options, explain the value and let the customer decide what they'd like to buy them so they aren't wasting time with games and lots of discarded paperwork.

We shopped around at multiple big-name dealerships before coming to Ken Garff, and the second we walked in the door we saw and felt the difference.

We knew we were in good hands every step of the way with them helping us out. If the owner or Manager is reading these comments, please buy these guys dinner or something, they deserve some special treatment after the awesome experience we had. The only recommendation I have is maybe include some movie tickets or a gift certificate with each car purchase, when you buy a new car you want every excuse to take it out and drive it around and if you have a gift certificate, well then you have to drive the car to go out and use it ;) Thanks again!",FALSE,2,0,5,4 years ago,0,4 years ago,We're so glad to hear that!

Zachary Miller,"This was my first dealership experience and I have to say it was REALLY disappointing.Things actually weren't too bad until we started signing paperwork on my lease. It took a very long time to get paperwork agreed upon, printed, and signed. After all of that I drove the car off the lot and thought everything was squared away and good.A week later a received a call informing me that I had signed paperwork for the wrong car and that I would need to sign paperwork again for the right car. I do not live in Orem so the paperwork had to be mailed to me. Upon receiving the new paperwork I discovered that my monthly lease payment had increased a couple of dollars above what I had previously agreed upon at the dealership (despite the overall price of the car being the same).I called to inquire as to why the change in price and was told that because the car that I leased was ""newer"" than the one I signed paperwork for (both were 2015 models) the monthly price was increased. This didn't make sense to me whatsoever but not wanting to deal with the hassle of it anymore I signed the paperwork and sent it back thinking my problems were over.Now three weeks removed from driving the car off the lot, I find out that the set of spare keys that I was given to my car are actually the set of keys for the car that I signed the wrong paperwork for. Now I have to have my real spare keys sent to me and I have to mail back the wrong set along with the owners manuals.It's really just been a big hassle to me to have to keep finding problems with the purchase. I'm worried I'll find something else somewhere else down the line and have to call the dealership up again to get it fixed.Another issue I found was that when I called to get the new paperwork explained to me and why the increase in price, I was offered a free detailing of my car, but rather than send me a certificate to have this done, I'm supposed to visit the dealership, speak with the accountant who assisted with the paperwork, and ""remind him of who I am"" and he'll get me the right services going on my car. Without any kind of documentation or physical agreement, I fully expect to never be able to redeem this perk I was given as a result of the mistakes on the dealership's part. I wouldn't expect anyone to remember a person they spent an hour or two with months down the calendar. I am really unlikely to do business with this location or Ken Garff dealerships in general and would recommend looking at other options in the area if you are able. I'm just really disappointed in how all of this has transpired and wished I had better things to say about my experience.Really small changes to their customer service model would really benefit the customer and it's disappointing that a company who prides themselves on listening to their customers fails to meet the needs and expectations they set for themselves.",TRUE,40,9,1,3 years ago,0,3 years ago,"Zachary, we're sorry for the hassle you experienced.

Lauren Marie,"The only bright side was the guy that installed my windshield wiper inserts. He was awesome. I wish I remembered his name. Every other experience I've had with them has been awful.I'm partial to going to the dealership because I used to work for one before I moved out of state. I had a good relationship with those service advisors and they never tried to sell me on something I didn't need.I went in to this particular dealership in Orem, UT for a simple oil change. I tried calling first to make an appointment and after about 10 minutes of being transferred around in circles I gave up and just hung up. I tried to just stop in and was told it would be a two hour wait. So I left and scheduled an appointment online. After the oil change, they told me to repair my breaks. After taking my car to another mechanic I was told they were only half worn. And they wanted to charge me $240 for something that wasn't even needed yet!As the service advisor was going over other recommended services, he recommended I change my transmission fluid (along with every other fluid). When I mentioned that I had just had my transmission fluid changed 3 weeks before, he said that he was recommending it because it wasn't in their records. So if the work wasn't done there, it doesn't count apparently? He would have let me spend another $150 on that without even checking to see the condition of the fluid to start with!This was the second time I have been here. The first was long enough ago that I don't remember details. I do remember feeling like they were just trying to get me in and out without any appreciation for those who keep them in business.

Jared Vivyan,"Our experience started very well with the dealership with the vechicle sale but made a rapid decline after the sales experience sadly. I want to start off with a bad pre-sale ""inspection"". When we purchased the vehicle we noted that the coolant level was low and wanted them to top off the coolant as well as check out the problem along with the other issues that were noted. Every other issue was fixed as promised but the coolant level was just toped off and ""presumed good by the staff. As time went on I have had to add coolant a couple of times as it looses coolant after drives. We brought it into the mechanic there and NOW it needs a new radiator because of leaks from the top of the radiator. I find it hard to believe that this could not have been seen when the inspection on the vehicle was done before we purchased the vehicle or when they were suppose to check it out when we noted the res was low. Now this turns into a $700 fix we are responsible for.Another issue is the oil change that was performed. We bought the 3 services package with advantage care and we finally used our first one when we had the radiator checked again. Well after receiving the frustrating news that they feel ""horrible about"" on the radiator I went to get in the car and leave after the oil change and noticed my red oil light on. I went back inside and let them know and the employee checked the oil and noticed there was very little or no oil in the engine. They got distracted and forgot to put enough or any oil in my car. Luckily I didn't proceed in driving it and assume the light would just go off because they just did an oil change right but I think this is a very important step in an oil change that I payed for.... adding oil. This should be a big deal to anyone. They added oil and acted like everything was OK and it wasn't a big deal and offered me nothing else. Just glad I didn't leave for home with it. Feel if I would have had the vehicle checked out by an outside known mechanic it would have saved me the cost of a new radiator.

The technician assured me he would order a bunch of them and to return on Wednesday to get the fin re-installed.  I left work early on Wednesday to get there before they closed and upon arrival, I find out the technician never ordered the parts.  They pulled in another technician and he identified and ordered the parts, for me.  He apologized and said he would throw in the 2 bolts which are $3 each for free... woohoo.  He said to come in Friday after 11 and they would be here.  I switch shifts with another employee so I have time to get this done before I have to go to work.  This time when I get there, it turns out they ordered the wrong parts!  They ordered them again and told be to come in tomorrow (once again when I work).  I can't just drive from Salt Lake to Provo real quick on a lunch break or anything.The reason why this is so urgent is because I need this fixed in order for my van to pass a safety test so I can renew my tabs.  Not only have I wasted the gas making unnecessary trips between Salt Lake City and Orem, but I am doing so with expired tabs now which I can't renew until they get their act together and fix my fin.  Oh yeah, while I was there the 3rd time, there were 2 technicians trying to figure out how to attach the fin to my van.  It took them 15 minutes to realize they couldn't do it with the parts they ordered.  If it's this complicated for them to attach a break light fin to a car, I wouldn't trust them with any other maintenance or repairs.I tried calling the manager to figure out a resolution but he wouldn't answer his phone.

The Morning was very hectic and by no means was their Quick service quick at all but I understood having worked a dealership in a express maintenance program and been there before. So the service was not very good and the top of my engine cover still had oil spots from gloves on it. But the reason I give this 4 stars is that when I went to pay the service writer told me that they did not expect it to take that long so they didn't bill me for the Rotation.

Chris Otting,"I bought my car from here in 2010 and was satisfied with my customer service and encouraged my friend and sister to both buy a car from this location. It was when we went shopping for my sister that I ran into extremely distasteful service.We requested to look at used Honda Fit's and were told there was one on the lot so a salesman took us over to look at it. We found the car trashed and were told one of the manager's was using it for his own personal use because ""it was too good to be sold as used."" There was dirty gym clothes strewn over the back seat and the very potent smell of chewing tobacco throughout the car.The salesman apologized and asked to show us a few other cars while they got it cleared out and we agreed. We started test driving another car and were exiting the lot when these two guys with golf clubs start walking down the road. They look at us and then very slowly continue to walk down the middle of the road blocking our path. The salesman informed us that these were the managers, one of which was the very same person that trashed the Fit we were interested in.Needless to say, my sister did not buy a car that day. The only positive experience we had was the honesty and frankness of our salesman. I no longer suggest anyone buy a car from this dealership and will actively discourage people from buying used knowing the management's position on using the cars for personal use.This experience was in May and I avoided any interaction with the dealership until recently when I went in to see about a warranty fix on my car. I confess I was annoyed that I had to deal with this company again and may have been a little rude to the service technician over the phone.

Daniel Smith,"I recently got tires from this dealership, and I asked to pay for them when I ordered them, but I was told to do so when they came in, I then asked to pay when they were being put on, but I was told to do so when the service had finished. My mom works at the shop, and one of the techs agreed to work on my car, but I had wanted to get it written up, which didn't happen. The tech cross threaded my lug nut, and improperly balanced my tires, so a few days later I had to take it in, this time I went to the stockton honda, who charged me to rebalance my tires and take of the lug nut. Orem Honda then said they would only cover the lug nut, because I had no receipt, and they started harassing my mom for the tire payment. They overall have very few people who care about customer satisfaction, they mainly worry about the overhead. There are a few other instances where I have been dissatisfied, but my mom had finally convinced me to get service done at her shop. I was hesitant, because my brother in law is a mechanic, and though it would have costed a tiny bit more, I know I would've been treated well. I just have to say that they may give good deals, but overall, it is just to increase sales, and customers are rarely treated like people, more like objects or problems",FALSE,1,0,1,2 years ago,0,2 years ago,"Daniel, we apologize for the experience you had with our service department.

Brandon Merchant,"Service department is not the best. I took in my Honda Civic that I had bought a couple months ago from a different dealership for a misfiring problem. I had already diagnosed that it was not the spark plugs or coil packs. They had a deal for a $45 diagnosis which was the cheapest I had come across. After leaving it there for a day, they called me to tell me that it was the spark plugs, coil packs, and battery. I asked them to check again because I couldn't imagine why all four coil packs would go out at the same time. After supposedly looking at it again, they said that it for sure was those three things. They quoted me $500+ to fix it. I told them I could replace them myself for cheaper (all the parts came to about $290) and asked them to just leave it on the lot so I could come replace the parts myself when they came in. Since it is a CNG car I ordered iridium spark plugs (to deal with the higher heat), new coil packs, and a brand new battery. When they came in, I drove down to replace the parts and found the battery was dead (which has never happened in the few months of owning the car) and needed to jump start it. Luckily the person that drove me down had not left yet. I replaced everything and fired it back up. But, sadly, the misfire was still there. I managed to get it off the lot and home but decided to not keep driving it. The worst part about all this is that me and my wife are having our first baby in a couple weeks and I'm in my last semester of school. I very little money and it was very very hard to come up with the money for the diagnosis and the parts. Now, I have no money left for another diagnosis and/or repair, I still don't know what the problem is, and have an undriveable vehicle. So, I would not recommend people to go here to get their car fixed. When I dropped my car off, I over heard one of the guys telling a lady that she needed a new air filter and that it would be $90. You can get one at Walmart, Autozone, OReily, etc for a lot less. It seems that the cost of parts here is awfully expensive. I guess, if you don't care about the cost or having to possibly come back they'd be fine.

NO!  1 hour later, a man and lady come out hollering my name.  I stand up and am told that my van, which was just purchased, brand new, 2 months ago, with only 6000 miles on it now needs the tires aligned.  They try to sell me on their ""special"" this month which was $59.99 for the alignment, regularly $100.00.  Again I say, there must be a mistake.  A brand new van shouldn't have a need for alignment.  They tell me to take it to the acura dealership.  I was confused and asked ""why?  I bought it here!  It's only 2 months old."" Long story short, it wasn't my car and the guy was a jerk when we figured it out.  He said ""Obviously there is more than one SuzAnne here."" like it was my fault for standing up when they hollered my name.FINALLY, exactly 2 hours later, I walk back to ask for an update on the van.  They tell me that it is done and has been done for a while.  I get the keys, walk outside to the van, and am appalled.  It obviously was sprayed off and left to dry in the sun.  There are hard water spots on all the windows, the inside looks exactly the same as it did when I first arrived.  It hadn't been vacuumed, even.  Now when I was sold on the ""advantage care"" package, they promised a detail with every oil change.  Maybe I'm crazy, but I would think that detailing a car would require at least a vacuum?!?Obviously, we were screwed when we purchased the advantage care option.Horrible experience!

Brad Buccambuso,"Please read my update to my reviewLet me say that Ken Garff Honda's online marketing director contacted me personally through Twitter, and worked with me to finish the work promised in the value built to the sale price. He was very gracious while being genuinely vested in seeing whereh things got sideways with my service. He offered to have the work finished there or at a 3rd party, hooked me up with one of their brand-new Civis to take to Salt Lake City while my car was worked on, and even sweetened the deal with a personal touch by way of a gift card for dinner. Unmatched. While I would have appreciated some contact from our salesman, Wendell knows his stuff. Contact him if you feel uneasy and he'll assure you before or after.Previous review:""Worked with Kevin Burns to purchase a used Honda Odyssey. After playing nice and agreeing to some repairs before hand we come back after 4 days (had to order parts, no problem there), an find that carpet in the rear was ripped by someone stepping on the corner too hard in the back, and the driver's side door dented badly with the black vinyl coming off it like it was freshly dinged. Kevin swore up and down that those blems were there when he took the car in. My pictures at home prove otherwise. What a douche bag. When we got the car after Kevin said ""of course we'll do a full detail on your van"" the car had gum in the carpet still, stains on the headliner, stains in the carpet, goop in the cup holders, center consol, and glove box, and easily scrubbable blems on the paint. What a joke. Had to bring it in again today to redetail. After expressing my concern for Kevin's lack of honesty I gave him 3 tries to come clean and he refused to apologize or admit to a thing. Always fun to give a slime ball a chance to be honest when you have proof. He can live with it for all I care. Sales manager was much more polite after I complained of the douche baggery we received but still gave me a run around about the door. I'm shaking mad.""",FALSE,4,0,5,6 years ago,0,NA,NA

Coming back from So. Utah, she totaled the vehicle during a very nasty showstorm.  (Thank goodness for seat belts and good Honda structural integrety - she ended up with only a couple of scratches even though the vehicle went airborne and landed upside down.
She had purchased a service package consisting of 3 routine oil changes, but only used one.  When asked about a refund on the unused services, she was told that she was out of luck.

As I was walking away, I thought of something else, I walked over to another guy who told me something different about the same problem and gave me a higher quote... (I got my work done somewhere else.)Well I few months later I thought I'd try again and go get a genuine honda oil change for my honda. I drove up to the express service. There were two guys working there chatting with a girl in her car ahead of me. I thought perhaps at least one of them would come over and see what I needed. I waited about five minutes. But I guess they don't do that there. (instead they stay and flirt with women in there cars? or so it appeared.) So I walked in to find someone to ask how long it would take. There was a guy at the counter, he looked right at me, he was just standing there with his arms folded and didn't say a word to me. Ok... I thought. Finally after a lady finished typing something long on her computer, I got someone to answer my question. (the whole time, the guy at the counter who was obviously a mechanic, just stared at me the whole time.) She told me THey finish doing oil changes in 30 minutes. Come back another day.... Really?
